Invoice information extraction is the process of pulling critical data like invoice number, amount, and date from the invoice. Accounts Payable (AP) teams must enter all invoice information into your organizationâ€™s accounting software for processing. The Invoice Information Extraction System extracts useful information from a scanned copy of an invoice. 

The steps involved are:
* preparing the input image for analysis through preprocessing
* automatically reading the invoice using an OCR tool
* extracting the useful information
